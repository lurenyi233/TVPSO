## Introduction
Time Variant PSO (TVPSO) [1] is a refinement of stochastic evolution algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [2]. PSO is mainly used in solving function optimization problems (find the optimal set of an _n_-dimensional vector subject to an evaluation function).

PSO uses a swarm of particles to simulate birds flocks looking for food. Each particle has a random initial position _**X**_ and velocity _**V**_. The position _**X**_ is an _n_-dimensional vector which represents a possible solution to the optimization problem. The objective function (evaluation function) targeted to be optimized is used to evaluate each particle position’s fitness. Higher fitness means a better position. For each particle, PSO uses _**pbest**_ (persnal best) to record the best position this particle has arrived. For the whole swarm, _**gbest**_ (global best) is used to record the global best position achieved by all particles. 

Particles' velocity will be updated based on pbest and gbest, and then move to new positions iteratively till all particles converge to the 'optimal' position (the solution of optimization problem).

## Updating Methodology
At time _t_, PSO updates each particle’s velocity using the following equation:
>_V<sub>t+1</sub> = wV<sub>t</sub> + c<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>(pbest − X<sub>t</sub>) + c<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>(gbest − X<sub>t</sub>)_

where _w_ is the inertia weight, _c<sub>1</sub>_, _c<sub>2</sub>_ are the acceleration coefficients and _r<sub>1</sub>_, _r<sub>2</sub>_ are two random numbers in the range between 0 and 1. After updating the velocity, each particle will move to a new position according to:
>_X<sub>t+1</sub> = X<sub>t</sub> + V<sub>t+1</sub>_

TVPSO also updates _w_, _c<sub>1</sub>_ and _c<sub>2</sub>_ according to the following iterative equations:
>_w<sub>t</sub> = (w<sub>e</sub> - w<sub>b</sub>)(t / maxt) + w<sub>b</sub>_ <br />
_c<sub>1t</sub> = (c<sub>1e</sub> - c<sub>1b</sub>)(t / maxt) + c<sub>1b</sub>_ <br />
_c<sub>2t</sub> = (c<sub>2e</sub> - c<sub>2b</sub>)(t / maxt) + c<sub>2b</sub>_ <br />

where _w<sub>b</sub>_, _w<sub>t</sub>_ and _w<sub>e</sub>_ denote the beginning, current and end value of _w_ respectively (similar for _c<sub>1</sub>_ and _c<sub>2</sub>_), _t_ is the current iteration number and _maxt_ is the maximum number of iterations.
